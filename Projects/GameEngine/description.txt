3rd Year Game Engine Project
---
This was a capstone project for my university course, involving creating a game engine utilising middleware.
It contains a fully functional scripting system using C++ and w64devkit's portable C++ compiler and can be used to make games in 2d.
Scripts are injected into the game engine using a DLL, which is dynmaically compiled based on when file edit times, 
allowing for fast recompilation by only building the neccessary object files when at runtime.
