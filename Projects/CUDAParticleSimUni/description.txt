CUDA Particle Simulation
---
A university module focusing on GPU compute programming. In the module, I wrote CUDA code to simulate particles in an electric field.

The renderer itself is simplistic, not needing to be excessively fancy to display the simulation accurately.

I created a version of the simulation using Blender's Geometry Nodes for a high quality render of the simulation.
